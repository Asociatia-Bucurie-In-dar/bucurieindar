In those moments you need support and I strongly believe that the team of the St. John The Merciful Center will strive to bring relief, healing and be a support to those who will tell us, help us.",

      "TITLE": "School of joy",
      "DESCRIPTION": "The children we help today are the educated adults of tomorrow. Education is fundamental. By supporting these children's access to education, you are also helping the community and the contribution they will in turn make to the community and this country. With your help, these children will discover the world, a world different from the one they live in now. Through them, you will also find joy! Also, we all know that the phenomenon of bullying has escalated in Romania, and many children are victims. We believe it is easier to prevent than to fight a phenomenon and that together we can help the little ones have healthy relationships with their peers. We share with you the 'School of Joy' workshop project, which starts with a story – 'The Hedgehog's Heart. An Adventure in Search of True Friends' (author: Mariana Buric). The workshop includes games and activities that can be done with children by teachers, in kindergartens and schools, but also by parents, at home. We would be delighted if among you there are teachers and parents who want to join us in this project. Let's help the little ones enjoy going to kindergarten or school and enjoy the friendship of their peers. For project details, please contact us. Thank you!"

Ensure what you can from the needs of a disadvantaged family: a medicine or a box of milk powder, basic food items, a notebook or a pencil for a student, are things that, unfortunately, some cannot afford on a constant basis.
