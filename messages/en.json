Also, we all know that in Romania the phenomenon of bullying has increased, and many children are victims. We believe that it is easier to prevent than to fight a phenomenon and that together we can help the little ones to have healthy relationships with their peers. We share with you the workshops project \"School of Joy\", which starts from a story - \"The Heart of the Hedgehog\". An adventure in search of true friends\" (author: Mariana Buric). The workshop contains games and activities that can be done with children by teachers, in kindergartens and schools, but also by parents at home. We would be happy if among you there are teachers and parents who want to join us in this project. Let's help the little ones enjoy going to kindergarten or school and enjoy the friendship of their peers. Of the 300 children we support at school with your help, not one has dropped out of school!"

These people who live on the streets, some of them were teachers, intellectuals, others were too good with their children and kicked out of the house, some as a result of disappointments, the death of children, they ended up under the open sky, but they are freer than many of us. Some of them, abandoned in the hospital, raised in children's homes or left to their own devices. They usually don't look you in the eye when you give them food, they look down, but when they get to look at you and thank you, know that it's the most sincere thank you received from a human and you've done a merciful deed before God! Whenever our life can change, let's be thankful for what we have and not forget them. You help through us. Together with the First Responder, we feed and treat them as best we can. Help us help them!"

        "TITLE": "The Importance of Charitable Donations",
        "DESCRIPTION": "In a world full of uncertainty and challenges, acts of charity shine like beacons of hope and humanity. Charity is not just a gesture of compassion; it is a bridge that connects souls, offering those less fortunate a chance at a better life. Charitable donations are vital for supporting this noble cause, and here's why. Direct Impact on People's Lives Through donations made to charitable organizations, we contribute directly to improving the lives of those in need. Whether it's food, shelter, education, or access to medical services, every donated dollar can make the difference between despair and hope for someone. Strengthening the Community Our donations help build and strengthen the community. When we support charitable causes, we join forces with other donors and volunteers to fight against inequalities and to create a fairer and more compassionate society. Education for Future Generations Donations in the field of education ensure that future generations will have the necessary resources to learn and thrive. Education is the foundation upon which the future is built, and our support can open doors that would otherwise remain closed. Personal Fulfillment Donations are not just about giving; they're also about receiving. The personal fulfillment and inner peace we feel when helping others are priceless. It's proof that, regardless of our own difficulties, we can make a positive difference in the world. Positive Influence Through our example, we inspire others to be generous and to engage in acts of charity. Generosity is contagious, and when we show our support for charitable causes, we motivate those around us to do the same. In conclusion, charitable donations are much more than a simple transfer of financial resources. They are our expression of solidarity and empathy towards those in need. Every contribution, no matter its size, matters and has the power to transform lives. So, let's open our hearts and be generous. Every act of charity is a seed of goodness planted for a brighter future.",

        "TITLE": "The Importance of Mental Health and Well-Being",
        "DESCRIPTION": "In today's tumultuous times, mental health has become a crucial topic in discussions about well-being. Maintaining mental health is not just about preventing or treating specific conditions, but it's about creating a balance in our daily lives that allows us to realize our potential and cope with everyday stress. Mental health influences the way we think, feel, and act. Therefore, it is essential to take time for self-care and to seek support when necessary. Creating a supportive environment around us, where open dialogue about emotions and internal struggles is encouraged, can have a significant impact on our well-being. Activities such as meditation, physical exercises, and creative hobbies can contribute to improving mental health. It's also important to recognize that seeking professional help is a sign of strength, not weakness. In the end, mental health is not a destination but a continuous process of growth and adaptation, and every step we take to care for our minds is a step towards a more fulfilled and happier life.",
